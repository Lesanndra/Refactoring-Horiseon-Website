# Horiseon

## Purpose

This repository is part of a Refactoring project.

The Horiseon website was refactored for web accessibility. Some of the factors taken into consideration were: 

1) Semantic HTML elements.

2) HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.

3) Image elements have accessible alt attributes.

4) Heading attributes fall in sequential order.

5) Title elements are concise and descriptive.

6) links are functioning correctly.

7) CSS selectors and properties were consolidated and follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.

8) Comments are included before each element or section of a page.
